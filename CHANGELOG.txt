Fractal — Update Changelog

• Payment Flow Overhaul
  - Desktop: Checkout opens in a centered popup (~90% screen width, max 1920px), height 780.
  - Mobile: Smooth same‑tab redirect with a "Redirecting to checkout…" overlay.
  - If a popup is blocked, auto‑fallback to same‑tab with overlay.

• "Redirecting…" Overlay
  - New in‑app overlay provides clear feedback before navigating to checkout.

• Wider Desktop Popup
  - Popup width now scales to ~90% of screen width for a more immersive flow.

• Product Modals Consistency
  - Standardized "View Details" modals (Fortnite, Tarkov) with height cap and scroll (max-h 85vh) for consistent sizing.
  - Rust modal currently retains original sizing; can normalize on request.

• Metadata Tweak
  - Updated status page social preview title to "since 2025".

What this means
- Faster, cleaner checkout with fewer blocks on desktop and a smoother experience on mobile.
- More consistent product detail modals across titles.
